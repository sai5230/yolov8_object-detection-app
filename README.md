🚀 Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv8
📌 Project Description

This project is a Real-Time Object Detection Web Application built using YOLOv8 and Streamlit.
It allows users to upload an image and detects multiple objects using a pre-trained deep learning model.

The model identifies objects, draws bounding boxes around them, and displays confidence scores.

🧠 About YOLO

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection algorithm that detects multiple objects in a single forward pass of a neural network.

This project uses YOLOv8 (Ultralytics implementation).

The model is pre-trained on the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, which contains 80 object categories.
